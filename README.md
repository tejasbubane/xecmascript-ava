# xecmascript-ava

First few problems from [Exercism](http://exercism.io)'s [ecmascript track](https://github.com/exercism/xecmascript) converted to use the [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test runner.

This has following advantages:

* Remove use of any build tool to run tests
* Modern testing env with nice diffs
