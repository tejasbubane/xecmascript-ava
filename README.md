# xecmascript-ava

First few problems from [Exercism](http://exercism.io)'s [ecmascript track](https://github.com/exercism/xecmascript) converted to use the [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test runner.

This has following advantages:

* Remove use of any build tool to run tests
* Modern testing env with nice diffs

### Steps to run tests:

* `cd` into any exercise directory.
* For the first time, you will have to install all required dependencies using `npm install`.
* Run the tests using `npm test`.
